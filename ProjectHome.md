The idea of DOMAssistant is to provide a simpler and more consistent way to script against the Document Object Model (DOM) in web browsers. The idea is that everything starts with the element in question, and then performs various methods on it, such as adding/removing classes, finding elements with a certain className, applying events to it, etc.
